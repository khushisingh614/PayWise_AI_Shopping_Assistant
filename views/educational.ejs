                <h3>Credit</h3>
                <p>Credit refers to the ability to borrow money or access goods or services with the understanding that you will pay later. It is essentially a trust agreement between the lender and the borrower. Credit can take various forms, including loans, credit cards, and lines of credit.</p>

                <p>A debit is an accounting entry that results in either an increase in assets or a decrease in liabilities on a company's balance sheet. In personal finance, a debit card allows you to spend money by drawing on funds you have deposited at the bank.</p>

                <p>EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment, a fixed payment amount made by a borrower to a lender at a specified date each calendar month. EMIs are used to pay off both interest and principal each month so that over a specified number of years, the loan is paid off in full.</p>
